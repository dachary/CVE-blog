What is CVE?
    CVE or Common Vulnerability and Exposures is a database maintained by MITRE which identifies, defines, and catalogs publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The international, community-based program is focused on providing the universal language to all the vulnerabilities across the globe. It is a standardized method for identifying and identifying security vulnerabilities in software and other systems. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) is responsible for coordinating the assignment of CVE IDs. Once a vulnerability is identified, it is assigned a unique CVE ID, and vulnerability information is created and added to the official CVE List. This information can then be used by security professionals and software developers to understand the nature of the vulnerability and take appropriate action to mitigate it.

How is CVE ID assigned?
    The process of assigning a CVE ID to a vulnerability typically begins when a researcher or other individual discovers a vulnerability in a piece of software or other system. They will then notify the appropriate party, such as the software vendor, who will confirm the vulnerability and provide details about it. Next, the NCCIC or one of its designated partners will assign a unique CVE ID to the vulnerability and create a vulnerability information record on the official CVE List. This information will include details about the vulnerability, such as the affected software, the nature of the vulnerability, and any known exploits. Once a CVE ID is assigned, it is added to the official CVE List, which is publicly available and can be used by security professionals and software developers to understand the nature of the vulnerability and take appropriate action to mitigate it. It is important to note that the NCCIC and its partners are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of information in the CVE List, so the allocation of a CVE ID does not imply any judgement on the severity of the vulnerability, but rather a unique identifier for it.

Advantages and Disadvantages of CVE
    Benefits of using CVE include:
•	Standardized identification: CVE provides a standardized method for identifying and naming vulnerabilities, which makes it easier for security professionals and software developers to understand and communicate about the nature of a vulnerability.
•	Improved communication: The use of a unique identifier for each vulnerability makes it easier for different parties to share information about a vulnerability and collaborate on mitigation efforts.
•	Increased visibility: The official CVE List is publicly available, which allows security professionals and software developers to easily find and access information about known vulnerabilities.
•	Better tracking: CVE IDs can be used to track the progress of a vulnerability from discovery to resolution, which can help organizations understand and improve their vulnerability management processes.

Limitations of using CVE include:
•	Limited information: The information provided in a CVE record may not be detailed enough to fully understand the nature of a vulnerability and the potential impact it could have on an organization.
•	Overcrowding: The number of vulnerabilities being discovered and reported has grown exponentially in recent years, making it harder to keep track of all the vulnerabilities and their respective CVE IDs.
•	Lack of context: Some vulnerabilities can be affected by different factors like the environment, the specific configuration, etc. Therefore, a single CVE ID may not be enough to understand the vulnerability's impact on a specific organization.
•	Limited scope: The scope of CVE is limited to software and other IT systems, and does not include other areas of vulnerability such as physical security, organizational policies, procedures and people.


    CVE is not only the vulnerability database out there, there are various databases but CVE provides centralized and standardized database. There are several vulnerability databases that provide information about known vulnerabilities, including:
•	Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE): This is a widely used database that provides a standardized method for identifying and naming vulnerabilities. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) coordinates the assignment of CVE IDs and manages the official CVE List on behalf of the US government.
•	National Vulnerability Database (NVD): This is another widely used vulnerability database that is managed by the NCCIC. It provides more detailed information about vulnerabilities, including CVSS scores, which can be used to understand the potential impact of a vulnerability.
•	SecurityFocus: This is a well-known vulnerability database that provides information about known vulnerabilities, as well as a variety of other security-related information such as exploits, tools, and security advisories.
•	OpenVAS: This is an open-source vulnerability scanner that can be used to scan networks for vulnerabilities. It also provides a vulnerability database that can be used to look up information about known vulnerabilities.
•	vulnerabilityalert: This is a commercial vulnerability management platform that provides a comprehensive view of vulnerabilities across all assets, both on-premises and in the cloud. It also provides a comprehensive vulnerability database that can be used to look up information about known vulnerabilities, and it is continuously updated.
Other databases like the Exploit Database, the PacketStorm Security, the Symantec Security Response and many more also exist to provide information about known vulnerabilities.
